# queendom-sentiment-analysis

This project conducts sentiment analysis on comments left on the subreddit r/kpop about the South Korean girl group survival shows *Queendom* and *Queendom 2*.

# Motivation

During the airing of *Queendom 2*, I observed many Redditors claiming that they had found the first season, *Queendom*, significantly better, citing reasons like an unappealing lineup, lacklustre performances, and a poor voting system. *Queendom 2*â€™s average TV viewership ratings were also lower than those of the first season. However, some believed that these opinions were the result of looking back at the past with rose-tinted glasses.

I sought to quantitatively compare the comments about these two seasons left on r/kpop during their respective airtimes to see whether the first claim held true.

# Status

This project is no longer being updated, and is here as an archive of the first project I attempted as a beginner. It has much room for improvement, but I have chosen to shift my focus towards other endeavours :)
